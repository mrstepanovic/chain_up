When you use your Visa or debit card at a shop, the shop's computer asks Visa to pull funds out of your account. Visa looks up your balance in its database, transfers the money to the shop's bank account, and records history of the transaction.

Visa is using a _centralized_ database: 
* only some Visa employees can view it
* even fewer Visa employees can modify it
* it runs on hardware managed by Visa

Every bank and traditional financial institution today -- Visa, Discover, Amex, Chase, Wells Fargo, Charles Schwab, etc. -- has its own centralized database to record transactions. They use a software messaging system called SWIFT to relay information about these transactions to one another and settle your balance at the end of the day. SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is how the world tracks money. It was invented in 1973. Steve Jobs was 18.

Despite its age, SWIFT is the standard. It's slow and inefficient -- your coffee purchase at Starbucks might need to be routed through multiple banks and several lines of international credit to be processed -- but it works. Moreover, it powers international trade! So if SWIFT ain't broken, why fix it?

There are a few reasons:
* Privacy: Banks and payment processors actively sell your personal transaction data to third parties for profit
* Power: Banks influence, and are influenced by, politics on the global stage. Governments have the legal power to force banks to freeze your personal property.
* Performance: SWIFT has slower processing speeds than many emerging blockchain networks.
* Economic freedom: if I want to donate money to a non-profit organization in Ethiopia, I should be able to send it to them instantly and directly. Currently, banks need to wire money, settle balances, and comply with regulations for international payments -- sometimes taking days or weeks.

(I will try to stay as politically neutral as possible, but crypto is inherently tied to political values... freedom, open-source access, and borderless international trade being a few. In US politics, it might be described as libertarian.)

If we want to take back control of these things, we need a _decentralized_ database and payment system: a blockchain.

A blockchain is just fancy database software. What makes it special is that it operates as a peer-to-peer network on the internet. It is completely public and permissionless. Blockchains don't ask you to create an account and upload your personal information. Blockchains can't reject you from participating. You simply turn on a compatible computer, install blockchain software, tell the network that you're online and ready to process transactions, and go.

The implications of this are tremendous. Nations lose their ability to control the flow of money. In the early days of Bitcoin (2013-ish), a good portion of transactions were used for organized "crime", namely internet drug markets such as the infamous Silk Road. Rather than paying for illegal goods with cash, buyers and sellers could create anonymous Bitcoin wallets and send money over the internet in plain sight. Although the Silk Road was shut down and seized by the FBI, many such markets still exist. 

When nations lose the control of money, they also lose some of their ability to enforce taxation. That can sometimes turn into a death spiral:
1. Nations can't generate income through taxation
2. They print more money to fund projects and operations 
3. The injection of new money dilutes its value, leading to inflation
4. Inflation increases prices for goods and services
5. More money is printed
6. More inflation is caused
7. ...
8. Eventually, social unrest breaks out and the national government's power is weakened
