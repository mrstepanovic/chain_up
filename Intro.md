I've spent the last decade reading crypto project whitepapers, day trading, gaining and losing money on NFTs, connecting with developers at conferences, prowling internet forums, and sifting through crypto Twitter nonsense. But the "aha" moments still keep coming.

Every time I tell someone that I'm "into" crypto, eyes start rolling. They might be  total stranger or a dear friend -- the reaction is always the same. I believe I surround myself with intelligent, reasonable people. So if these intelligent, reasonable people are still scoffing at the paradigm shift currently unfolding in digital culture, it's still very, very early.

I'm writing to brain dump everything I know about decentralized technology in a bite-size, easy-to-understand format. As I write, I'm thinking about how I would explain things to people I love: my [very non-technical] mother, my skeptical best friend, the completely clueless folks I meet at a bar. 

Complex new technologies attract cringeworthy buzzwords, snake oil salesmen and saleswomen, ponzinomics, and scam artistry. Crypto has all of them. But beneath the crud, there are fascinating nuggets of invention, creativity, leadership, and social good. I'm here to teach you what I know so you can frontrun, as I have, the crypto tsunami rolling in. 

If you're seeing dollar signs right now, that's a normal first reaction. That was my first reaction as well. Eventually, I noticed that wealth building opportunities became more passive, like a side effect, as I discovered the deeper ethical values of decentralization. Crypto wasn't created to make you rich, it was created to set you free.

Let's chain up and climb this mountain.
