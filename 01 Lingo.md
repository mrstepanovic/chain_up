In order to make sense of what I'm writing, you'll need to know 3 pieces of special vocabulary.

1. __Cryptography__: a field of research exploring ways to use math to secure private communications.
2. __Cryptocurrency__: a digital token or asset that can be exchanged between people using cryptography instead of a secure intermediary, such as a bank.
3. __Blockchain__: a type of database that organizes data, typically cryptocurrency transactions, into chunks of information ("blocks") that are stored, processed, and verified by a globally distributed network of people running blockchain software

Putting it all together: blockchain technology uses cryptography to secure transactions of cryptocurrency (and other digital assets) over the internet.
